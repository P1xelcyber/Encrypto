# Encrypto-
A program in python for encrypting files in python to keep them safer if u for example wanna delete a file and dont want it some one to find it because as you should know deleting software isn't safe because it can be brought back becuase the file gets marked as free space but still can get back and if you don't want that to happen the use Encrypto++ to encrypt the files befor deleting

# safety
Encrypto++ is very safe and it is impossible to decrypt without key even if they try brutte force it and even then they need about 2^2285 years and being honest people lose interest after 1 day 

# Encryption
as you can see in the file it uses fernet as encryption and it uses Symmetric-key algorithm

# Educational and safety purpose
the software is not for malicious purpose it's for safety and educational purpose and so i don't take responsible for what you do with it
