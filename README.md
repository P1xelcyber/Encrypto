# Encrypto++
Encrypto++ is a Python program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt files using the Fernet encryption algorithm from the cryptography package. This program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to select files or directories to encrypt or decrypt, generate encryption keys, and save or load encryption keys.
Installation
To use Encrypto++, you need to have Python 2.7, Python 3.4+, or PyPy 5.3+ installed on your computer. You also need to install the cryptography and tk package using the following command:
pip install cryptography
pip install tk

## Encrypto++ 1.1
New update!

New things:
-New Gui
-New theme
-Fix Encryption on Folders
-Fix Decryption on Folders

## Usage
To run Encrypto++, simply run the encrypto.py file using Python. This will open the GUI window, where you can perform the following actions:
-Generate a new encryption key by clicking the "dice" button.
-Load an existing encryption key by clicking the "Load Key" button.
-Save the current encryption key by clicking the "Save Key" button.
-Select a file or directory to encrypt or decrypt by clicking the "file" or "folder" buttons.
-Encrypt the selected file or directory by clicking the "Encrypt" button.
-Decrypt the selected file or directory by clicking the "Decrypt" button.
## Security
this program is extremly secure and almost impossible to crack without the key. no on can get back the original file if the key is gone.and if you would brutte force it then it would take some million years.
